**Welcome to the Lir tutorial.**

Here is how I _suggest_ you read this tutorial:

First, go ahead and clone this repository to your computer.
Then, open [the source file](https://github.com/borisvassilev/lir-tutorial/blob/master/docs/anagrams.lir).
Read the Lir source!

In parallel, open [the final document](https://borisvassilev.github.io/lir-tutorial/anagrams.html).
You could make use of the links in it.

But don't forget that the aim of this tutorial is to show you how to use Lir.
It is much better to first read the Lir source file.
The final document will help you understand the effects of running Lir.
