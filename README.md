Welcome to the Lir Tutorial
---------------------------

This tutorial will introduce you to the [reproducible computing tool Lir](https://github.com/borisvassilev/lir).
Before starting, please make sure you have [installed all prerequisites](http://borisvassilev.github.io/lir/index.html#prerequisites) and [Lir itself](http://borisvassilev.github.io/lir/lir.html#installation).

Clone this repository to your computer, and change to the working directory:

~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/borisvassilev/lir-tutorial.git
$ cd lir-tutorial
~~~~

Now, open [the tutorial `anagrams.lir`](anagrams.lir).

You **must read the literate source file**.
If you try to read the generated final document, you will not be able to follow.

Read the literate source file provided!

Use Lir to generate the final document!

Run all examples!


(You could, in parallel, open [the final document](https://borisvassilev.github.io/lir-tutorial/anagrams.html), to be able to see what you _should_ get without actually running Lir on the source file.
This is the best way to skim through this tutorial and be left with a faint feeling of dissatisfaction.)

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce you to the Lir syntax, the Lir tools, and best practices for using Lir.
