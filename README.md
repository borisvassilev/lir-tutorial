**Welcome to the Lir tutorial.**

This tutorial will introduce you to the [reproducible computing tool Lir](https://github.com/borisvassilev/lir).
Before starting, please make sure you have [installed all prerequisites](http://borisvassilev.github.io/lir/index.html#prerequisites) and [Lir itself](http://borisvassilev.github.io/lir/lir.html#installation).

Clone this repository to your computer, and change to the working directory:

~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/borisvassilev/lir-tutorial.git
$ cd lir-tutorial
~~~~

Now, open [the tutorial `anagrams.lir`](anagrams.lir).

You **must read the literate source file**.
If you try to read the generated final document, you will not be able to follow.
Read the literate source file provided!

(You could, in parallel, open [the final document](https://borisvassilev.github.io/lir-tutorial/anagrams.html), to be able to see what you _should_ get without actually running Lir on the source file.
This is the best way to skim through this tutorial and be left with a faint feeling of dissatisfaction.)

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce you to the Lir syntax, the Lir tools, and best practices for using Lir.
