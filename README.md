**Welcome to the Lir tutorial.**

Here is how I _suggest_ you read this tutorial:

First, open [the source file](https://github.com/borisvassilev/lir-tutorial/blob/master/docs/anagrams.lir)
Keep in open, and look at the plain Lir source.

In parallel, open [the final document](https://borisvassilev.github.io/lir-tutorial/anagrams.html).
Look at this document and make use of the links in it.

But don't forget that the aim of this tutorial is to show you how to use Lir.
It is much better to first read the Lir source file, and later look at the final document to understand the effects of running Lir.
